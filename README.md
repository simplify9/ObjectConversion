[SW.ObjectConversion](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimplyWorks.ObjectConversion/) is a set of
conversion extensions methods to stream line object conversion, especially in its tedious and
nuanced forms. (*Eg:* Casting an ISO datetime string into a DateTime object)

# Conversion Methods

- **ConvertValueToType**: extends `object` and takes in a `Type` as a parameter and goes through the process of different methods of conversion to get the optimal result. Note that is optimized to avoid redundant or unnecessary conversions.
